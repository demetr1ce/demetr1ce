# Hello 👋

I am Demetrice. Welcome to my sandbox, my time capsule, my collection of odds and evens. I am a full stack software engineer by trade, front-end developer at heart.

When I'm AFK, you can usually find me hanging out with my family 👨‍👩‍👧, gaming 🎮, hiking ⛰, watching movies 🎥, reading 📚, working around the house 🛠, or on vacation 🏖

## Tools of the Trade:
C#/.NET ・ Azure (Compute, Networking, Storage, Databases, DevOps) ・ HTML ・ CSS ・ JavaScript ・ TypeScript ・ React ・ APIs ・ SQL
