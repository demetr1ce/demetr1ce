# Hello, fellow Hubist 👋 I am Demetrice Ledbetter

Welcome to my sandbox, my time capsule, my collection of odds and evens. I am a full stack software engineer by trade, front-end developer at heart. I've been doing this privately for a long time, but I think it's time to start sharing.

When I'm AFK, you can usually find me hanging out with my family 👨‍👩‍👧, gaming 🎮, hiking ⛰, watching movies 🎥, reading 📚, working around the house 🛠, or on vacation 🏖

## Tools of the Trade:
HTML ・ CSS ・ SCSS ・ JavaScript ・ TypeScript ・ React ・ Node ・ Rest API ・ (No)SQL ・ C#/.NET
